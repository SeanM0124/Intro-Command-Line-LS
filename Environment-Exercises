Run the following commands to experiment with altering your command line environment:

$ cd
$ PS1="\u@\w$ "
ubuntu@~$ echo "Hello world"
Hello world
ubuntu@~$
*/
#Used PROMPT='%n:%m: ' due to being on zsh, prompt lasted until i exited the session, when reopen it return to normal.
#echo 'export PS1="this is a test$ "' >> ~/.zshrc - Using this the prompt carried over to the new session

/* As discussed previously in this chapter, the PATH variable determines which files can be executed without specifying their path explicitly. 
Run through the commands in this exercise to see this principle in action. */

echo $OLDPATH
cd /usr/local

#Now, create an executable in your home directory by entering the following:

cd ~
echo '#!/bin/bash' > test.sh # Replace existing test.sh file
echo 'echo "Hello world"' >> test.sh
chmod +x test.sh # Make sure test.sh has the executable permission

#Run the executable, first by specifying the path, then by running it like a command:

$ ./test.sh
Hello world
$ test.sh
zsh: command not found: test.sh

#Now, change PATH more permanently for your current session, and try to run test.sh again:
